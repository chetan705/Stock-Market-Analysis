# Stock Price Prediction

Welcome to the **Stock Price Prediction** project! This web application leverages artificial intelligence to predict stock prices with high accuracy, designed for investors and analysts seeking a competitive edge. Deployed live at [https://stock-market-analysis-0whn.onrender.com](https://stock-market-analysis-0whn.onrender.com), this platform combines a user-friendly interface with powerful backend processing and AI-driven insights.

## Overview

This project is a full-stack application that uses machine learning models to analyze historical stock data and provide future price predictions. It features an intuitive interface for uploading datasets, training models, and visualizing predictions, making it a valuable tool for financial decision-making.

## Features

- **Real-time Stock Data Integration**: Seamlessly connects to live market feeds, updating stock data in real-time to provide the latest insights for accurate predictions, ensuring you’re always ahead of the curve.
- **Custom Dataset Uploads for Training**: Allows users to upload their own CSV datasets, which the platform processes and uses to train the AI model, tailoring predictions to specific stocks or portfolios with customizable parameters.
- **Interactive Prediction Visualizations**: Displays predictions through dynamic charts and graphs, enabling users to explore trends, compare scenarios, and adjust variables interactively for a deeper understanding of market movements.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), RESTful APIs
- **AI Engine**: TensorFlow (RNN/LSTM), scikit-learn
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Additional Tools**: jQuery, Chart.js

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chetan705/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required Python packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: The requirements.txt file should include Flask, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and other dependencies. Create it if not present with:

bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add any necessary API keys or configurations (if applicable):

text
FLASK_ENV=development
Run the Application
Start the Flask server:

bash
python3 app.py
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5000.

Usage

### Notes
- **Active Link**: The README includes the live link https://stock-market-analysis-0whn.onrender.com.
- **Prediction Issue**: Mentioned in the Features and Future Improvements sections as a known issue to address later.
- **Setup**: Instructions assume a standard Flask structure; adjust paths or commands if your setup differs.
- **File Placement**: Save this as `README.md` in your project root. Ensure `requirements.txt` and other files are present or created as noted.

Run `python3 app.py` to verify locally, and the README will shine on GitHub or your project directory.
